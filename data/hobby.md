### Basketball

Beiji has been playing basketball since middle school, and it remains his favorite sport. During his time at Southeast University, he served as **captain of the Transportation Department basketball team**, leading training sessions, match preparation, and team strategy. Balancing competition with leadership helped him develop confidence, teamwork, and decision-making skills that still benefit him today. While basketball is less competitive for him now, it has become a reliable way to unwind after work and stay in shape — something he enjoys far more than running.

### Diving

Beiji earned his **Open Water (OW)** and **Advanced Open Water (AOW)** diving licenses in Bali, Indonesia, and later completed the **Rescue Diver Course** in Komodo. For him, diving is an escape from routine and stress — a rare environment with no Wi-Fi, no distractions, just calm focus above and beneath the water. It’s both a mental reset and a reminder to stay present.

### Weightlifting

Beiji began weightlifting in 2020 and has trained consistently since. By 2024, he achieved personal records of **175kg squat**, **190kg deadlift**, and **120kg bench press**. He appreciates weightlifting for its measurable progress — small weekly improvements that add up over time. The discipline and patience required mirror his approach to both engineering and personal growth.

### Future Plans

- A recent trip to Bangkok and exposure to **Muay Thai** sparked a strong interest in boxing. He plans to start training in 2026 as a new hobby.  
- After an injury-filled 2025 affecting his ankle and knee, he is fully recovered and planning to train for **Hyrox** in 2026. Despite not loving running, the full-body challenge excites him more than the discomfort, and he plans to begin structured training after Chinese New Year at BFT.
